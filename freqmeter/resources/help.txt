  User manual:
  
  - Clic 'Settings' button or select 'File->Settings' menu.
  
  In the settings dialog select the right settings for your serial connection.
  You can use the 'Scan' button to rescan serial ports if your port
  doesn't appear in the list.(it can take some time for the system to discover a newly plugged cable !)
  
  Clic 'Ok' to quit settings window. If everything is ok the 'Connect' button is now available.
  Clic it or select 'File->Connect' menu to connect to Arduino.
  The status bar should display:"Getting data from serial ..."
  Notice that you can have an error message:"Error reading data!". This is because most Arduino boards 
  will reset before establishing a serial connection. So don't worry!

  - Autorange mode : if you uncheck this box frequency will only be displayed in Hz ( 10kHz = 10000Hz).
  
  - Fast / slow mode : in slow mode frequency is measured every second.
  Fast mode gives fastest readings but can be a bit less accurate.
  
  - Hold mode freezes the display (but Arduino still refreshes readings)

  - Scale factor : You can select a multiplier if you're using an external frequency divider.
    You will get a direct reading of the frequency.

  - Clicking 'Show graph' button will display a new window where data is displayed as a graph.
  X an Y grid check boxes make x and y grids visible or not.
  When checked, the 'Ylog' check box will force y axis to be displayed in logarithmic scale. This is usefull
  if you have wide frequency variations on input signal.
  Saving graph data : right clic on the graph and select export. You can save a screenshot as an image or
  save raw data in csv format.
  Be aware tha saving an image (or copying to clipboard) can make the software crash.
  This is due to an issue with pyqtgraph module. You will find instructions on how to fix it in pyqtfix folder.
