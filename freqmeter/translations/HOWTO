How to create a new translation:

1- Edit the 'translations/lang.idx' file and add a new entry: Language,code,file (ex : English,en_US,freqmeter_en)
This makes the new entry visible in the language selector dialog.

2- Create a translation file (or edit an existing one).
The file structure:
	- first line is a description and is not used for translation but must be there.
	- section: contains translations for a dialog.
	  A section starts with [:section_name,number_of_lines  (ex: [:freqmeter,34
		section_name: used for loading a section with my_strings_list = load_section(file_name, section_name)
		number_of_lines: tells the load_section() function how many lines to load
	  Then come the strings, each one in a new line.
	  Sections are separated by a blank line.

Using translations:

# import loading tool
from tools.langtranslate import load_section

my_translations_file = 'translations/freqmeter_en'

# populate a list of strings from a translation file
my_translations_list = load_section(my_translations_file, 'freqmeter')

# print the loaded strings
for translation in my_translations_list:
    print(translation)
